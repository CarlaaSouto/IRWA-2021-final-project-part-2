# IRWA-2021-final-project-part-2

This part is for Indexing and Evaluating the tweet dataset that we have.
The code is a notebook and to use it we only need to execute all cells.

The necessary imports are at the first cell and for this part of the project we need to install the libary gensim in order to make the final plots.


For indexing we used the tf-tdf indexing and for the 5 querys that we choose:

- covid vaccine
- hospital doctor
- fast food
- covid symptoms
- sport injuries

and print the 10 more relevant tweets. And after that, we used different methods to evaluate the quality of our algorithms.
