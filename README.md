# IRWA-2021-final-project-part-2

This part is for Indexing and Evaluating the tweet dataset that we have.
The code is a notebook and to use it we only need to execute all cells.

The necessary imports are at the first cell and for this part of the project we need to install the libary gensim in order to make the final plots.
